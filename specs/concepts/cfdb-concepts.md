# Spec: cfdb-concepts

The shared bounded-context resolver — a pure-library crate (zero heavy deps) that loads `.cfdb/concepts/<name>.toml` override files and computes a crate→bounded-context mapping using a two-layer strategy (explicit TOML overrides win over crate-prefix heuristic).

Extracted from `cfdb-extractor/src/context.rs` in Issue #3 so that the future `cfdb-query` DSL evaluator can share the same loader without transitively pulling in `syn` + `cargo_metadata`. The crate is the Rust-level implementation of the Conformist pattern ratified in council-cfdb-wiring §B.1 (was qbot-core #3841).

Dependency discipline: no `syn`, no `cargo_metadata`, no `ra-ap-hir`. Pure TOML + serde. Consumed by `cfdb-extractor` today and by `cfdb-query` once `ContextMap` lands (per issue #49).

## BoundedContext

Return type of `compute_bounded_context` (RFC-038 slice 2). Pairs the resolved context `name` (the same string the function returned pre-RFC-038) with a `cfdb_core::ContextSource` discriminator that surfaces the override-vs-heuristic provenance previously discarded at the API boundary. `Declared` when the result came from a `.cfdb/concepts/<name>.toml` override; `Heuristic` when it came from prefix stripping or the no-prefix fallback. Slice 3 (#302) plumbs `.source` to `:Context.source` emission; this slice exposes the discriminator at the API surface so every caller is forced to decide what to do with provenance.

## ConceptOverrides

Loaded override map — reverse lookup from crate name to the owning `ContextMeta`. Returned by `load_concept_overrides`; consumed by `compute_bounded_context`. Internally a sorted `BTreeMap` for determinism. Provides `lookup(crate_name)` for per-crate resolution and `declared_contexts()` for enumerating every context declared across all TOML files.

## ContextMeta

The resolved context metadata for one bounded context. Carries the context `name`, an optional `canonical_crate` (the crate that holds the canonical implementation of the context's concepts), and an optional `owning_rfc` reference (doc path). Emitted as a `:Context` node during extraction; also used as the per-Crate `BELONGS_TO` edge target and as the source of `Item.bounded_context` stamping.

## LoadError

Error type produced by `load_concept_overrides` and `load_published_language_crates` — covers filesystem access failures (`Io` with the offending path) and TOML parse errors (`Toml` with the offending path plus the boxed `toml::de::Error`). Propagated to the caller so malformed concept / published-language files fail loudly rather than silently falling back to the heuristic. Duplicate `name` entries inside `.cfdb/published-language-crates.toml` surface as `Io { ErrorKind::InvalidData }` — a reused vocabulary, not a new variant.

## PublishedLanguageCrates

Loaded Published-Language marker list — reverse lookup from crate name to `PublishedLanguageEntry`. Produced by `load_published_language_crates` against `.cfdb/published-language-crates.toml`. Consumed by `cfdb-extractor` at extraction time to materialise the `:Crate.published_language: bool` prop that the `:Finding` classifier (issue #48) reads to suppress false Context-Homonym positives for crates that are cross-context by design. Exposes `is_published_language(crate_name)`, `owning_context(crate_name)`, and `allowed_consumers(crate_name)` — all three return `Option`/`bool` values without interpreting consumer wildcards (the `"*"` semantic is the classifier's job). Internally a sorted `BTreeMap` for determinism. Missing file ⇒ empty map ⇒ every crate emits `published_language: false`.

## PublishedLanguageEntry

Metadata for one Published Language crate — fields `language` (short identifier like `"prelude"`), `owning_context` (the bounded context that authors the language), and `consumers` (list of contexts expected to consume it; `["*"]` is wildcard, interpreted by the classifier). Stored as the value type in `PublishedLanguageCrates::by_crate`. Fields are public by symmetry with `ContextMeta` — the loader is data-only, so lattice-crossing invariants live in the classifier, not here.
